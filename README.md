# Survival
> My own idea for a game develoved with JS Canvas

Dodge asteroids and outlast your friends in this intense top-down survival game built with JavaScript Canvas! ☄️ Choose solo or team up with up to 4 players and navigate a treacherous asteroid field. Each hit depletes your health, and the last player standing claims victory! Test your reflexes and strategic thinking as you maneuver through the ever-increasing asteroid bombardment. Will you emerge victorious or succumb to the perilous space environment? ☠️

Controls:

Player 1: Arrow keys
Player 2: WASD keys
Player 3: IJKL keys
Player 4: 8,4,5,6 keys
